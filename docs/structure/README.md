## Top-level files

Each subsection here contains a brief description about the files at the top-level of
this Git repository.

### `.envrc`

A file containing environment variables for the Git repository that can be selectively
loaded. [`.envrc` uses the `direnv` shell extension to load these environment
variables][direnv].

This file contains a `sed` command to output a `.env` file with all the environment
variables. This may be useful for sourcing environment variables, for example in
conjunction with PyCharm's EnvFile plugin.

To ensure this `sed` command works correctly, make sure any file paths listed in this
file are absolute file paths (recommended). Relative file paths using other
environment variables only work for Python users. Environment variable names can
only contain letters, numbers or underscores as well. For example:

```shell
export DIR_DATA=$(pwd)/data                    # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$(pwd)/data/external  # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=./data/external       # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external    # fine for Python users only
export DIR-DATA-EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external    # will break the `sed` command!
```

### `.flake8`

A configuration file for the `flake8` Python package that provides linting. This file
is based on the [common configuration described in the GDS Way][gds-way-flake8].

### `.gitignore`

A `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and folders from this Git repository. [See
the contributor guide to modift the `.gitignore` file][docs-updating-gitignore].

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

[A pre-commit hook configuration file][docs-pre-commit-hooks].

### `.secrets`

A file to store all secrets and credentials as environment variables. [This file is
read-in by `.envrc`](#envrc), when [loading environment variables with the `direnv`
shell extension][direnv], but is not tracked by Git.

### `.secrets.baseline`

[Baseline file for the `detect-secrets` to detect secrets][detect-secrets]. In
conjunction with `pre-commit`, `detect-secrets` prevents secrets from being committed
to the repository. The baseline file flags secret-like data that the user deliberately
wishes to commit the to repository.

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

[The Code of Conduct for contributors to this project][code-of-conduct], including
maintainers and `ukgovdatascience` organisation owners.

### `conftest.py`

File to contain shared fixture functions for the `pytest` tests in the `tests` folder.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

The contributing guidelines for this project.

### `LICENSE`

The licence for this project. Unless stated otherwise, the codebase is released under
the MIT License. This covers both the codebase and any sample code in the
documentation. The documentation is Â© Crown copyright and available under the terms of
the Open Government 3.0 licence.

### `Makefile`

The `Makefile` contains a set of commands for the `make` utility. Run the `help`
command for further information at the top-level of the Git repository.

```shell
make help
```

### `pyproject.toml`

A file containing Python project settings. This includes configuration settings for:

- [`isort`](#isort)
- [`pytest`](#pytest)
- [code coverage](#code-coverage)

#### `isort`

Python imports are arranged according to the [specification defined by `black`][black].

#### `pytest`

To run the tests within the `tests` folder using the `pytest` Python package, enter
the following command:

```shell
pytest
```

#### Code coverage

To run code coverage using the `coverage` Python package with `pytest`, enter the
following command:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

or using the `make` command:

```shell
make coverage_html
```

A code coverage report in HTML will be produced on the code in the `src` folder. This
HTML report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

### `README.md`

An overview of the Git repository, including all necessary instructions to run the code.

### `requirements.txt`

A list of Python package requirements for this Git repository, which can be installed
using the `pip install` command.

```shell
pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, to install the requirements file along with pre-commit hooks, run the
following command:

```shell
make requirements

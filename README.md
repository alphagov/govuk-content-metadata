## Getting started

To start using this project, [first make sure your system meets its
requirements](#requirements).

To be added.

### Requirements

```{note} Requirements for contributors
[Contributors have some additional requirements][contributing]!
```

- Python 3.6.1+ installed
- a `.secrets` file with the [required secrets and
  credentials](#required-secrets-and-credentials)
- [load environment variables][docs-loading-environment-variables] from `.envrc`

To install the Python requirements, open your terminal and enter:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Required secrets and credentials

To run this project, [you need a `.secrets` file with secrets/credentials as
environmental variables][docs-loading-environment-variables-secrets]. The
secrets/credentials should have the following environment variable name(s):

| Secret/credential | Environment variable name | Description                                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Secret 1          | `SECRET_VARIABLE_1`       | Plain English description of Secret 1.     |
| Credential 1      | `CREDENTIAL_VARIABLE_1`   | Plain English description of Credential 1. |

Once you've added, [load these environment variables using
`.envrc`][docs-loading-environment-variables].

# ü™ê spaCy Project: Content Metadata NER

A project for building a lanuage model for HM Governmentt

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | Download a spaCy model with pretrained vectors |
| `db-in` | Load labelled .jsonl file data into prodigy |
| `train_prodigy` | Train a named entity recognition model with Prodigy |
| `train_curve` | Train the model with Prodigy by using different portions of training examples to evaluate if more annotations can potentially improve the performance |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `db-in` &rarr; `train_prodigy` &rarr; `train_curve` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/gold/mark_goppepdm.json` | Local | JSONL-formatted training data exported from Prodigy (2970 examples) |
